# Minimum Spanning Tree Program

This program demonstrates use of Kruskal's algorithm to create a minimum spanning tree. (don't look for comments on how it all works as this was supposed to be a quick project for fun)

The program will display a bunch of moving circles, which is will connect in a minimum spanning tree every frame, this creates a nice little animation of the tree updating as nodes move around.

To add more nodes press the up arrow, likewise press the down arrow to remove nodes. Press c to clear all nodes, and press r to reconstruct a new set of nodes (keeping the current number of nodes the same)


On a side note, this program was also used to test functionality between tkinter and pygame, which is why a basic pygame window is nested inside of tkinter
