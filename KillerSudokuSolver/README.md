# Killer Sudoku solver

A basic program to solve sudoku puzzles, and the killer sudoku variant, using backtracking

Use arrow keys to move cursor, 1-9 to enter in a number, backspace to clear a cell, 'c' to clear all cells

Use space to solve board all at once, press L_control to enter advance mode and use 'a' to advance through the steps one at a time

For killer sudoku, press Left Shift to enter "sum mode" and move cursor over every cell to be covered by the sum. Next type in the number for the sum of the covered cells (i.e. type 12 if the sum of the cells must add to 12). Once this is done, press Left Shift again to exit sum mode and see the changes. Solving works as usual, but will usually take longer for a killer sudoku variant due to the blank board. See https://www.dailykillersudoku.com/ for good test examples.
