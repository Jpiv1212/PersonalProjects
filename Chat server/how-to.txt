Python 3 required, on windows only. Best run in command line (not idle or similar)

To use, first open the server and enter the desired port number (might have to port forward depending on where the server is located)
next open any clients and enter the ip and port that the server is on
client will automatically connect to the server, and can then run the following commands:

exit - pings the server to exit, server will reply if okay to exit
sub <topic> - subscribes to the specified topic, server will automatically send back retained posts and any new posts after
post <topic> /retain{optional} <message> - posts a message to be immediately seen by everyone subbed to it, and if /retain is used the message will be retained in the topic
unsub <topics...> - unsubscribes the user from the topics provided, and returns which ones unsubscribed, and which ones failed
list - lists out all the topics that the client is subscribed to currently

Using exit is the correct way to close the client, but if closed by Ctrl+C or any other method, the server handles it gracefully and doesn't crash
